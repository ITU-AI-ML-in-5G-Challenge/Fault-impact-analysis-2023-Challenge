Order of Executing the .ipynb Files:

1.Ensure you are working in the Anaconda environment on your PC. Extract the provided training and validation zip files to separate folders named "train" and "validation_clean."


2.Begin by running the "1. DATA READING AND VISUALIZATIONS.ipynb" file first.


	-This step is necessary to generate the "train.csv" and "test.csv" files, which are used in the subsequent "2. MODEL SOLUTION.ipynb" file.
	-The notebook also provides visualizations, including correlation maps that demonstrate limited correlation between KPIs.
	-Make sure to modify the path as required to match the folder where you've downloaded the datasets.


3. Proceed to run the "2. MODEL SOLUTIONS.ipynb" file.


4. For the final submission on Zindi, use the output from the last step, specifically the "ensemble.csv" file resulting from the ensemble process.
